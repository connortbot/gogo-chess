# gogo-chess 0.3.0

Discord Bot for the DMRPG, GoGo World. Run using the Discord.js library.

GoGo Chess is an RPG that can be run on your very own Discord server! Primarily on the main GoGo World server, which will be posted here in v0.4.0.
Inspired by the likes of Pokebot, Genshin Impact, and other RPGs, this game involves pitting your GoGos against monsters and even other player's teams! You can level them up, give them gears and weapons, and see them become the strongest version of themselves, all while fighting new bosses and dungeons.

Although the game/bot is not open to the public (not until v0.4.0, that is), you'll be able to see current events below!

If you are interested in developement or helping out, or even just have feedback, please do not hesitate to contact my student email: ctloi@uwaterloo.ca
