# gogo-chess

== GOGO CHESS 0.2.0 ==
Discord Bot for the DMRPG, GoGo World. Run using the Discord.js library.

Currently, the project is built on a local SQLITE3 database. It is not maintained within this git.
Running the program will create it - just remember to run:
`global_counter.create({call: 0, counter: 0});`
This will create the only required template for the database.
